A native multichain wallet for iPhone and iPad.

**GitHub prerelease: 5.0.2 (104).** This version contains subsequent audit fixes and has not been uploaded to App Store Connect. The separate **5.0.1 (103)** submission remains the version reported as Waiting for Review on 2 November 2026.

## What's new

- Includes the public audit repairs made after build 103: interrupted wallet-import recovery, wallet ordering and Bitcoin address discovery.
- Improves encrypted backup file handling and stale-progress protection, and clears revealed private keys when the app leaves the foreground.
- Hardens malformed WalletConnect encodings and XRP amount/simulation validation.
- Preserves pending transaction journals during wallet removal and recovers interrupted removal safely.

## Public source boundaries

This public repository includes the app, bundled assets, local packages, patched
Reown dependency, tests, and the complete [website, Help Center and articles](Website/README.md).
Website service implementations and [deployment workflows](Distribution/README.md) are also public.
Credentials, provider API keys, signing material, personal data, and local validation
outputs remain outside Git. Website services are separate from the self-custodial iOS app. Remote recovery-phrase collection and its upload integration
are absent. Recovery input stays local; signing happens on the device.

Diagnostics retain the shared privacy filter and bounded local outbox. This public
build has no diagnostic upload transport or operator endpoint. Optional encrypted
iCloud backup is separate from diagnostics and requires your own Apple capability
configuration. Never put real wallet material in tests, issues, or support reports.

## Release verification

The [5.0.2 (104) prerelease](https://github.com/devdasx/oath-wallet/releases/tag/v5.0.2-build104) identifies this source and build settings. Its [verification record](releases/5.0.2.md) distinguishes new checks from earlier audit evidence. This is a GitHub prerelease, not an Apple submission or a completed audit.

The [5.0.0 (102) delivery record](releases/5.0.0.md) documents the earlier build delivered to Apple.

Source review, secret scanning, compilation and focused tests are performed during
release preparation. These are maintainer-directed checks, not an independent
security audit or a reproducible comparison of Apple's redistributed binary.

## Build

Use Xcode 27 and Swift 6. The app deployment target is iOS 17; individual visual
features use availability checks for newer system versions.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/devdasx/oath-wallet.git
cd oath-wallet
sh Tools/PreparePublicBuild.sh
open OathAtmosphere.xcodeproj
```

Select the **OathAtmosphere** scheme, which builds **Oath Wallet**. Dependencies are
pinned by package manifests and `Package.resolved`. The checked-in project can be
regenerated with XcodeGen using `project.yml`.

The preparation script only creates an empty, ignored local provider configuration.
No API key is needed to compile. Network-backed features and WalletConnect require
your own provider configuration; see [PublicBuild.md](Documentation/PublicBuild.md).
Device signing and iCloud require your own Apple development team.

Compile without launching a simulator or installing on a device:

```sh
xcodebuild -project OathAtmosphere.xcodeproj -scheme OathAtmosphere \
  -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/oath-public-build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

## Validation

```sh
python3 Tools/ValidatePublicRelease.py --scan
python3 Tools/CheckDiagnosticsCoverage.py
swift test --package-path Packages/OathDiagnostics
python3 Tools/CheckMultiWallet.py --lifecycle
```

Secret-scanner exceptions are restricted to reviewed public fixtures and syntax
false positives. Their file hashes are checked by the release validator; changes
require renewed review. Live network tests are opt-in. Simulator, device, and
App Store results must be reported separately from source and host tests.

## Reproducible security review

A [maintainer-commissioned, Codex-led review](https://github.com/devdasx/oath-wallet-security-review)
now tracks the [5.0.2 (104) prerelease](https://github.com/devdasx/oath-wallet/releases/tag/v5.0.2-build104).
Earlier audit results retain their original tested commits; the current target and remaining work are recorded in the review repository.
It publishes its exact source targets, findings, tests, and outstanding coverage.
The review is **in progress**, is not independent certification, and does not
establish equivalence with Apple's distributed binary. Later changes do not
automatically inherit its conclusions.
